	This project resembles a shopping cart for a mock online shirt store called "Suburban Shirts". The application has several components (for the header, products, routing, etc), and uses an array of objects to populate different shirt products onto the DOM. On the home page, a user can add a project to their cart, and will be notified when doing so. Using frontend routing, this app takes you to the cart page, where a user can track, add and remove items that are currently in their shopping cart.
